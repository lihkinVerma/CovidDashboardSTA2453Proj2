# CovidDashboardSTA2453Proj2
This dashboard is for the Covid data showcasing to a larger audience, and also as a course requirement for STA2453 as a project 2 for Data Science Collaboration and Communication
## Data Source
The data used in this dashboard is from the public Github repository (https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json) where data is collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
## Framework
The framework used for building the dashboard is Shiny, which is an open-source R package for building interactive web applications. The components in shiny applications have a polished look and are accessible cross-platforms (device portability). Also, the dashboards made using this framework are versatile, provide the capability to integrate well with different visualization modules and advanced graphical libraries of R . All this combined makes it a first choice for developing an interactive dashboard.
